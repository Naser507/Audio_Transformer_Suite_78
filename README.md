UI Layout & Spacing Refinements

This update introduces layout and spacing improvements to enhance logo visibility and overall visual balance across the application UI.

Header

Repositioned the application logo to sit next to the header text.

Aligned the logo–text group to the right for a cleaner, more modern header layout.

Slightly adjusted horizontal padding to improve spacing and visual flow.

Changes implemented via a new structural wrapper in header.html and updated alignment rules in header.css.

Left Panel

Reduced excessive vertical spacing above and below the main logo.

Improved compactness of the left panel without affecting readability or scroll behavior.

Adjustments ensure better use of vertical space, especially on smaller viewports.

These refinements improve clarity, consistency, and visual hierarchy while preserving the existing design language.

### Update (2025-12-11 11:31:36)
We added our first left panel but it needs a lot of style changes before we can move on with that.
